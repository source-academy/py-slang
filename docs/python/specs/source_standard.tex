\section{Standard Library}

The standard library contains constants and functions that are 
always available in this language. 

In py-slang, the standard library functions are not implemented 
using a conventional split between primitive and predeclared 
functions. Unlike in Source, where predeclared functions are 
defined using built-in primitives, all standard library functions 
in py-slang are written directly in TypeScript and embedded into 
the runtime of the CSE Machine. These functions are treated as 
part of the host environment rather than as user-level definitions, 
and they interact directly with the evaluator's internal control 
stack and environment. This design simplifies the interpreter 
architecture and allows for tighter integration with the execution 
model, enabling better support for visualization, error handling, 
and platform-specific extensions within the Source Academy learning 
environment.

The standard library for Python \S $x$ is documented in online 
documentation of Python \S $x$.
