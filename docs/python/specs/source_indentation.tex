\subsection*{Indentation}

In Python,

indentation}
is syntactically significant and strictly enforces code block structure. Unlike languages using braces, 
Python employs whitespace (spaces or tabs) to delimit blocks for control flow (e.g., \texttt{if}, \texttt{for}, \texttt{while}), function definitions, and class declarations. Key rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Consistency: Use 4 spaces per indentation level (PEP 8 recommendation). Mixing tabs and spaces is prohibited.
\item Alignment: Statements within the same block must align vertically. Misaligned indentation raises an \texttt{IndentationError}.
\item Nesting: Each nested block increases indentation by one level. Dedenting resumes the outer block.
\item Line Continuation: For multi-line statements, align wrapped lines with the opening delimiter or use an extra level.
\end{itemize}
